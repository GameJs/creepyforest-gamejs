HammerTime
=========================

Play: http://gamejs.org/apps/creepyforest/

This is a GameJs.org app. Built around the time of http://html5gamejam.com 2011 to test audio capabilities

Only works in FF (bad sound bugs. I refuse to add all the workarounds. I'll wait it out).

Instructions
-------------
Your character follows the mouse. Left click to swish.
